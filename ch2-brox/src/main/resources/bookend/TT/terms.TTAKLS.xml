            <Title>WHAT&apos;S INCLUDED IN THE TOUR PRICE</Title>
            <Text>
	<div><strong>Inter-city Travel:</strong> By private motorcoach, trains and ferries (see itineraries).</div>
	<div><strong>Travelling:</strong> By air-conditioned luxury motorcoaches. Please note that on some Regional Tours and London sightseeing, motorcoaches without toilet facilities are used. In the Middle East and Morocco, air-conditioned motorcoaches (or minibuses in Israel) without toilet facilities are used. If due to circumstances beyond our control coaches are used otherwise than as advertised, a refund of $10 per person will be made.</div>
	<div><strong>Air transportation:</strong> Within Europe is included in the Land price only when indicated in the First Class Travel Highlights panel on specific itineraries.</div>
	<div><strong>Hotel accommodation:</strong> Prices are per person and based on two persons sharing a twin-bedded room with private bath or shower. When booking triple rooms please note that in some hotels may consist of one double bed and the third bed may be a &#8216;roll-away&#8217; bed which will limit space in the room. Availability of triple rooms is limited. In Europe quad rooms (available on select itineraries only) may be either two double beds or one double bed and two &#8216;roll-away&#8217; beds. Availability of quad rooms is limited and may be used only for two adults and two children - strictly not available for four adults. To qualify for quad discounts children must be 15 years of age or under. Note that single rooms in European hotels are generally smaller than twin-bedded rooms and that European hotel standards, facilities and services provided may vary from those in other parts of the world and are often local in style. Substitute hotels may be used at certain times and will be of similar standard whenever possible. There are a limited number of twin-shared rooms available with our Room Share Service. Passengers who are members of Hotel Frequent Traveller programmes are not entitled to earn points with any of the hotels featured on a Trafalgar guided holiday.</div>
	<div><strong>Cruises:</strong> Per person prices are based on two persons sharing a cabin with two berths, private shower and toilet. A limited number of single cabins are available at extra cost. On Nile cruises, triple rooms are not available.</div>
	<div><strong>Travel Director:</strong> Guided holidays are conducted in English only by a professional multi-lingual Travel Director. On some City Breaks there may be a Local Host instead of a Travel Director. Please refer to individual itinerary pages</div>
	<div><strong>Meals:</strong> In-flight meals and snacks are served according to airline policy. Continental or buffet breakfast on all tours except in Ireland and provincial Britain (not including London) where full national style breakfasts are served. Dinners are included as detailed on itineraries. All meals are included on cruises.</div>
	<div><strong>Sightseeing:</strong> Excursions and entrance fees to places of interest visited as detailed on each itinerary with an English-speaking guide where necessary.</div>
	<div><strong>Transfers:</strong> Between airports, hotels, railway stations and piers in Europe where indicated on each tour itinerary. For details and London transfers, see page 242.</div>
	<div><strong>Porterage &amp; luggage allowance:</strong> Baggage handling for one suitcase per person on tour, at hotels, is included in the tour price. Note that porterage on train tours at train stations is not included. Due to limited coach capacity, this single bag <strong>should have dimensions not exceeding 30&#8221;x18&#8221;x10&#8221; (76x46x25cm) and weight not exceeding 50 lbs (23kg).</strong> A charge of US$3 per travelling day will be collected by the Travel Director if a second piece of baggage is carried, or if the suitcase exceeds the established weight and/or dimensions. However it cannot be guaranteed that more than one suitcase will be carried. Hand luggage should be one piece per person and should be limited in size (not exceeding 30x28x14cm or 12&#8221;x11&#8221;x6&#8221;) so as to fit under your coach seat or in the small overhead shelf. These are the responsibility of each tour member and should be taken onto the motorcoach with you. <strong>Please note that luggage with telescopic handles and wheels will not fit in the overhead compartments and can therefore not be accepted as carry-on luggage for safety reasons.</strong> Trafalgar will not accept liability for any loss or damage to baggage or any of the passenger&apos;s belongings. Passengers should report any lost items to the Travel Director who will assist in completing a lost property form that can be used for any insurance claim in this matter. However, Trafalgar cannot assist in locating any lost items once the passenger has returned home.</div>
	<div>Airlines may impose stricter weight and size limits for luggage and may also charge fees for checked baggage, including the first checked bag. Please check with your airline(s) directly for baggage regulations and related fees. Trafalgar is not responsible for additional fees imposed by air carriers regarding baggage.</div>
	<div><strong>Tips:</strong> All tips are included for services on tour provided by dining-room waiters, chambermaids and porters at hotels, airports and docks.</div>

No surcharges regarding cost or currency fluctuations will be made to the LAND only price once the deposit is received. This guarantee however, excludes potential fuel surcharges and does not apply to taxes, charges or levies imposed by any government or its agencies. Airport taxes are subject to change. No refund will be made if costs are reduced. Please note that if the total tour price increases by more than 10%, passengers will have the right to cancel their tour within 7 days of notification of the surcharge without penalty. All prices are in New Zealand Dollars unless specified.</div>
<div><strong>Tour Participation:</strong> On all guided holidays children under 5 years are ineligible. Children under 18 years of age must be accompanied by an adult. Trafalgar strives to provide a safe, enjoyable and memorable travel experience for all passengers. Trafalgar welcomes passengers with special needs or disabilities. However, please note the following:</div>
<div>&#8226; Passengers are required to advise Trafalgar, in advance, of any physical, medical or other special needs that require accommodating.</div>
<div>&#8226; All guests must ensure they are medically and physically fit for travel. Trafalgar may impose safety requirements necessary for the safe operation of the tour. Trafalgar may also exclude an individual from participating in a tour or an activity if that individual&apos;s participation poses a direct threat to health or safety.</div>
<div>&#8226; Trafalgar does not provide personal devices (such as wheelchairs, hearing aids or prescription eye glasses) or services of a personal nature (such as pushing a wheelchair or assistance in eating, toileting or dressing). A companion capable of providing such assistance must accompany any passenger who requires services of a personal nature.</div>
<div>&#8226; Trafalgar does not employ medical personnel. Any necessary medical attention will be provided by a local facility at the passenger&apos;s expense. Trafalgar is not responsible or liable for any losses or costs incurred as a result of medical services obtained while on tour, or for the quality of the care or services received.</div>
<div>Passengers should be aware some tours include rough terrain, extensive walking over cobblestone streets, uneven pavement, steps and locations which may not be easily accessible or accessible by wheelchair. During the tour, Trafalgar may make arrangements with carriers, hotels and other independent suppliers to provide travel services. These parties are independent entities over which Trafalgar has no control. Accommodation on international tours may differ from those in New Zealand. Trafalgar cannot guarantee disability access or accommodation for passengers travelling on international tours.</div>
<div>Trafalgar may, in its sole discretion, decline the booking of any passenger or remove any passenger who cannot comply or refuses to comply with Trafalgar&apos;s terms and conditions. Trafalgar is not responsible for any costs incurred in the event a passenger is removed from a tour. Passengers agree not to hold Trafalgar or any of its related entities liable for any actions taken under these terms and conditions.</div>
<div><strong>Young Traveller 5 - 17 discount:</strong> The young traveller must be under 18 years of age on the tour departure date, and must be accompanied by an adult, sharing a twin room. The young traveller must be the specified age at the time of travel to be eligible for the applicable discount and is limited to one young traveller discount per room. This discount cannot be combined with our Travel With Family and Friends discount. See pages 24-25 for details.</div>
<div><strong>Itinerary variations and London Olympics 2012:</strong> Trafalgar constantly strives to improve tour itineraries and features. If such improvements can be made, or unforeseen circumstances beyond our control or big events such as London Olympics 2012, trade fairs or film festivals make changes necessary, we reserve the right to vary itineraries and to substitute hotels. At certain peak periods duplicate departures may operate, and sometimes in reverse order, in which case hotels may vary from those stated on the itinerary pages. On tours that include cruises the ship may be changed due to operational reasons. Ports of call on Mediterranean cruises may be curtailed if weather conditions do not permit docking. Departures in early and late season are potentially offered in cool weather. As a result, slight itinerary variations may occur and certain activities may not be available due to seasonality or weather conditions.</div>
<div>On locally hosted tours, sightseeing and other services may occasionally be provided by third parties in which case transportation and itineraries may vary.</div>
<div>Trafalgar&apos;s &#8216;Be My Guest&#8217; experiences are unique and take place in singular exclusive locations. In the unlikely event that our local hosts are unable to welcome Trafalgar guests, Trafalgar will attempt to find an alternate experience or a highlight meal will be provided in place of the &#8216;Be My Guest&#8217; experience.</div>
<div><strong>Holidays &amp; Changes:</strong> During local or national holidays abroad, certain facilities such as museums, sightseeing tours and shopping may be limited. In such instances, and whenever possible, slight itinerary changes are made by Trafalgar to minimize inconvenience to our passengers. If, however, you feel your enjoyment might be diminished by such minor limitations, please check with the respective national tourist office before selecting a specific departure. Similarly, holidays, closing days and other circumstances may necessitate a change of the day of the week for scheduled highlight dinners, sightseeing or other activities.</div>
<div><strong>Extended stays:</strong> If you have arranged with us to remain at a destination before or after your tour, please understand your stay will be at your sole expense as is the transfer to either the hotel or airport. Regrettably, Trafalgar is unable to provide free transfers for passengers booking pre and post night accommodation in Europe. Please also be aware if your extra night hotel is not the hotel where your tour begins or ends, you will be responsible for your own transfer arrangements at your own expense. Additional transfers can be purchased from Trafalgar, please see page 241 for details.</div>
<div><strong>Arrivals and departures:</strong> It is essential to allow at least one day before and after your tour if you are joining your Trafalgar tour in London. See page 240 for London hotels.</div>
<div><strong>For your comfort:</strong> Trafalgar operates a seat rotation system and seats on coaches cannot be booked. Also there is a strict non-smoking policy onboard motorcoaches, however, regular comfort stops are made on travelling days.</div>
<div><strong>Tour cancellation:</strong> Trafalgar reserves the right to cancel or re-schedule any tour departure in accordance with operating requirements or circumstances beyond its control. Trafalgar will, whenever possible, offer an alternative tour of similar standard. If there is a difference in cost, it will be at the passengers&apos; expense. If an alternative tour is not accepted by the tour participant within operating deadlines, we will refund all monies paid to Trafalgar and will be under no further obligation or liability. Trafalgar is not responsible for any additional costs/penalties incurred, on travel arrangements and air tickets. Trafalgar is not responsible for any other travel arrangements affected due to our cancellations.</div>
<div><strong>Travel Insurance:</strong> Trafalgar recommends that all passengers purchase comprehensive travel insurance. Certain European countries have a requirement for foreign visitors to have valid medical insurance on entry. Trafalgar cannot be held responsible if a passenger is denied entry for being unable to provide details to the authorities of such insurance.</div>

A detailed list and cost of these and many more exciting options are included in your travel documentation. You can only book and pay for them through your Travel Director, by cash, Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit cards.</div>

				<div><strong>Complaints procedure:</strong> Should you have a complaint in respect of your holiday, you should inform your Travel Director/Representative immediately. If the matter cannot be resolved after the Travel Director&apos;s/ Representative&apos;s best endeavours to do so during the holiday, your complaint can be made in writing to your local Trafalgar office.</div>
				<div><strong>Data protection:</strong> 1. In order to process your tour booking, Trafalgar will need to use personal information for you and other passengers included in your booking, which may include each passenger&apos;s name, address, phone number, email address, passport number, credit/debit card number and sensitive information such as health, medical, dietary, mobility, religious or other special requirements. This personal information may be passed on to other suppliers for your travel arrangements in addition to public authorities (such as customs and immigration), security and credit checking organisations, and otherwise as required by law. Similarly, we may also need to provide personal information to contractors who provide services to or for us (such as sending mail, processing payments, providing marketing assistance). This may involve sending personal information (including sensitive information) to other countries that may not afford the same level of protection of personal information. 2. We may also use the personal information you provide us to review and improve the tours and services that we offer, and to contact you (by post, email and/or phone) about other tours and services offered by Trafalgar that you may be interested in. If you don&apos;t want to receive this information or want a copy of the personal information we hold about you, write to us at Trafalgar Tours (NZ) Ltd, Attn. Marketing Department, 15/17 Day St (Level 2), P.O. Box 68-640, DX: CP27510 &#8216;K&#8217; Road, Newton, Auckland 1010.
