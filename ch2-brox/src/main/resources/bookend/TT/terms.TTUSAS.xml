            <Title>WHAT&apos;S INCLUDED IN THE TOUR PRICE</Title>
            <Text>
	<div><strong>Inter-city Travel:</strong> By private motorcoaches, trains and/or ferries (see itineraries).</div>
	<div><strong>Touring:</strong> By air-conditioned luxury motorcoaches with reclining seats and onboard restroom facilities. Please note that on some Regional Tours and London sightseeing and in the Middle East and Morocco air-conditioned motorcoaches (or minibuses in Israel) without toilet facilities are used. If due to circumstances beyond our control coaches are used other than as advertised, a refund of $10 per person will be made.</div>
	<div><strong>Air Transportation:</strong> Within Europe, intra-tour airfare is included in the land price only when indicated in the First Class Travel Highlights and/or pricing panels on specific itinerary pages.</div>
	<div><strong>Hotel Accommodations:</strong> Prices are per person and based on two persons sharing a two-bedded room with private bath and/or shower. Every effort has been made to reserve two-bedded rooms; however, on some occasions rooms with one bed may be the only choice available. These rooms will be allocated to single travelers and couples first; other rooms may feature a single bed and &#8216;roll-away&#8217; bed or sleeper sofa. There are a limited number of twin-share rooms available with our Guaranteed Room Share program. When booking triple rooms please note that in some hotels this may consist of one double bed and the third bed may be a &#8216;roll-away&#8217; bed which will limit space in the room. Availability of triple rooms is limited. Note that single rooms in European hotels are generally smaller than twinbedded rooms and that European hotel standards, facilities and services provided may vary from those in other parts of the world and are often local in style. Hotels listed on the itinerary pages are intended to be used on all departures; however, from time to time substitute hotels of similar standard (whenever possible) may be used for various reasons. Guests who are members of Hotel Frequent Traveler programs are not entitled to earn points with any of the hotels featured on a Trafalgar vacation. Special room requests such as smoking/non-smoking, adjacent, connecting or lowerfloor rooms must be requested at the time of booking. These special room requests cannot be guaranteed and are based on availability at the time of check-in.</div>
	<div><strong>Cruises:</strong> Per person prices are based on two persons sharing a cabin with two berths, private shower and toilet. A limited number of single cabins are available at an extra cost. On Nile cruises, triple rooms are not available.</div>
<div><strong>Travel Director:</strong> Guided vacations are conducted in English by a professional, multi-lingual Travel Director. On City Breaks there may be a Local Host instead of a Travel Director. In Egypt, only tours of 10 people or more will be guided by a Trafalgar Travel Director. In Turkey and Israel, tours are conducted by a Local Guide. Please refer to the individual tour pages.</div>
	<div><strong>Meals:</strong> In-flight meals and snacks are served according to airline policy. Continental or buffet breakfast on all vacations except in Ireland, provincial Britain (not including London) and Scandinavia, where full national style breakfasts are served. Lunches and Dinners are included as detailed on itineraries. All meals are included on cruises.</div>
	<div><strong>Sightseeing:</strong> Excursions, entrance fees and English-speaking guide (when required) are included as detailed on the itinerary pages.</div>
	<div><strong>Transfers:</strong> Between airports, hotels, railway stations and piers in Europe are included as indicated on each itinerary (please see page 242 for details on airport transfers). London airport transfers are included provided guests have booked a land and air package with Trafalgar. Included Gatwick transfers will be by express train. Conditions apply, refer to page 242 for details. There will be no refund for unused airport transfers.</div>
	<div><strong>Porterage &amp; Luggage Allowance:</strong> Baggage handling of one suitcase per person on tour, at hotels, is included in the vacation price. Note that porterage on Train Tours at train stations is not included. Due to limited coach capacity, a single bag <strong>should have dimensions not exceeding 30&#8221;x18&#8221;x10&#8221; (76x46x25cm) and weight not exceeding 50 lbs (23kg)</strong>. A charge of US$3 per traveling day will be collected by the Tour Director if a second piece of baggage is carried, or if the suitcase exceeds the established weight and/or dimensions. However, it cannot be guaranteed that more than one suitcase will be carried. Carry-on/hand luggage should be one piece per person and should be limited in size (not exceeding 12&#8221;x11&#8221;x6&#8221; (30x28x14 cm) in order to fit under your coach seat or in the small overhead compartment. Carry-on/hand luggage handling is the responsibility of each guest and must be taken on and off the motorcoach by you each day of the tour. Please note that carry-on/hand luggage with telescopic handles and wheels will not fit in the overhead compartments or under seats and, therefore, cannot be accepted as carry-on luggage for safety reasons. Airlines may impose stricter weight and size limits for luggage and may also charge fees for checked baggage including the first checked bag. Please check with your airline(s) directly for the most current baggage regulations and related fees (www.trafalgar.com/baggage). Trafalgar is not responsible for additional fees imposed by air carriers regarding baggage. Trafalgar will not accept liability for any loss or damage to baggage or any of the guest&apos;s belongings. Guests should report any lost items to the Travel Director who will assist in completing a lost property form that can be used for any insurance claim in this matter. However, Trafalgar cannot assist in locating any lost items once the guest has returned home.</div>
	<div><strong>Tips/Gratuities:</strong> All tips/gratuities are included for services on tour provided by dining-room waiters, chambermaids and porters at hotels.</div>

No surcharges regarding cost or currency fluctuation will be made to the LAND only price once the deposit is received in full. This guarantee however, excludes potential fuel surcharges and does not apply to taxes, charges or levies imposed by any government or its agencies. Airport taxes are subject to change. All prices are in US Dollars unless otherwise stated.</div>
<div><strong>Trans-Atlantic Airline Fuel Surcharges and Air-related Taxes, Fees and Restrictions:</strong>Airfares will be provided upon booking, will be based on roundtrip purchase, and will include air-related taxes, fees and fuel surcharges imposed by the airlines. Any additional fees charged by the airlines such as baggage handling (visit www.trafalgar.com/baggage for details), seat selections and/or any other services are the sole responsibility of the guest(s).</div>
<div><strong>Airline Special Requests, Availability and Gateways:</strong>Seat assignment and special meal requests can be requested at time of booking. Trafalgar cannot guarantee confirmation of preferences. Frequent Flyer miles can be accrued on most air carriers but Trafalgar cannot provide upgrades using mileage. Note that not all airlines automatically provide pre-reserved seats (any additional charges imposed by the airline(s) for pre-arranged seats is at the guests&apos; expense) or add Frequent Flyer numbers to records to flights booked and ticketed by Trafalgar unless they are informed by your Travel Agent. Seats are limited in our contracted class of service and are not available on every flight. Trafalgar does not hold block space on any airline and does not guarantee air availability for every tour departure* date. You should be advised that due to demand during peak travel times, there may not be availability in popular European gateways cities. Guests originating from different gateway cities and sharing a room or travelling with other guests, may not be confirmed on the same airline or routing. Seating and flight schedule changes are the sole responsibility of the airline.</div>
<div><strong>Tour Participation:</strong> On all guided vacations children under the age of 5 years old (8 years old for River Cruises) are ineligible to travel. Children under 18 years of age must be accompanied by an adult. Trafalgar strives to provide a safe, enjoyable and memorable travel experience for all guests. Trafalgar welcomes guests with special needs or disabilities. However, please note the following:</div>
<div>&#8226; Guests are required to advise Trafalgar, in advance, of any physical, medical or other special needs that require accommodating.</div>
<div>&#8226; All guests must ensure they are medically and physically fit for travel. Trafalgar may impose safety requirements necessary for the safe operation of the tour. Trafalgar may also exclude an individual from participating in a tour or an activity if that individual&apos;s participation poses a direct threat to health or safety.</div>
<div>&#8226; Trafalgar does not provide personal devices (such as wheelchairs, hearing aids or prescription eye glasses) or services of a personal nature (such as pushing a wheelchair or assistance in eating, toileting or dressing). A companion capable of providing such assistance must accompany any guest who requires services of a personal nature.</div>
<div>&#8226; Trafalgar does not employ medical personnel. Any necessary medical attention will be provided by a local facility at the guest&apos;s expense. Trafalgar is not responsible or liable for any losses or costs incurred as a result of medical services obtained while on tour, or for the quality of the care or services received.</div>
<div>Guests should be aware that some tours include rough terrain, extensive walking over cobblestone streets, uneven pavement, steps and locations which may not be easily accessible or accessible by wheelchair. During the tour, Trafalgar may make arrangements with carriers, hotels and other independent suppliers to provide travel services. These parties are independent entities over which Trafalgar has no control. Accommodations on international tours may differ from those in the United States. Trafalgar cannot guarantee disability access or accommodations for guests traveling on international tours.</div>
<div>Trafalgar may, in its sole discretion, decline the booking of any guest or remove any guest who cannot comply or refuses to comply with Trafalgar&apos;s terms and conditions. Trafalgar is not responsible for any costs incurred in the event a guest is removed from a tour. Guests agree not to hold Trafalgar or any of its related entities liable for any actions taken under these terms and conditions.</div>
<div><strong>Itinerary Variations and London Olympics 2012:</strong> Trafalgar constantly strives to improve vacation itineraries and features. If such improvements can be made, or unforeseen circumstances beyond our control make changes necessary, we reserve the right to vary itineraries and to substitute hotels. At certain peak periods duplicate departures may operate, and sometimes in reverse order; hotels may also vary from those stated on the itinerary pages. During local or national vacations, London Olympics 2012, Religious Festivals, Vacations, Trade fairs (e.g. Amsterdam IBC Congress) or other events (e.g. Venice Film Festival on Lido) certain facilities such as museums, sightseeing tours, shopping and some hotels may be limited. Similarly, vacations, closing days and other circumstances may necessitate a change of the day of the week for scheduled highlight dinners, sightseeing or other activities. Departures in early and late season are potentially operated in cool weather conditions. As a result, slight itinerary variations may occur, and certain activities may not be available due to seasonality or weather conditions. Availability of certain activities may also be limited due to itinerary variations. In such instances, and wherever possible, slight itinerary changes are made by Trafalgar to minimize inconvenience to our guests; and in these and other cases, substitute hotels may be used and will be of a similar standard and location wherever possible. If, however, you feel your enjoyment might be diminished by such limitations, please check with your Travel Agent before selecting a specific departure.</div><div>On tours that include cruises, the ship may be changed due to operational reasons.</div>
<div>On locally hosted itineraries, sightseeing and other services may occasionally be provided by third parties in which case transportation and itineraries may vary.</div>
<div>Trafalgar&apos;s &#8216;Be My Guest&#8217; experiences are unique and take place in singular exclusive locations. In the unlikely event that our local hosts are unable to welcome Trafalgar guests, Trafalgar will attempt to find an alternate experience or a highlight meal will be provided in place of the &#8216;Be My Guest&#8217; experience.</div>
<div><strong>Pre/Post-Tour Accommodations:</strong> If you have arranged with us to remain at a destination before and/or after your tour, please understand that your stay will be at your sole expense as is the transfer to either the hotel or airport. Please see page 241 for a list of pre- and post-tour accommodations. Space is limited and available for up to three nights before and/or after each tour. Breakfast and luggage handling is not included. Regrettably, complimentary transfers are not available for guests booking pre- and post-tour accommodations; however, inexpensive airport transfers by taxi, van or shuttle are available for purchase and must be booked at the same time as your pre/post-tour accommodations (see page 241 for details). Please also be aware that if your extra night is not at the hotel where your tour begins or ends, you will be responsible for your own transfer arrangements at your own expense.</div>
<div><strong>For your comfort:</strong> Trafalgar operates a daily seat rotation system and seats cannot be booked on coaches. Also, there is a strict non-smoking and no alcohol-drinking policy on board motorcoaches; however, regular comfort stops are made on traveling days.</div>
<div><strong>Young Traveler Discount:</strong> Young Travelers must be under the age of 18 years on the date of departure* and MUST
 be accompanied by an adult, sharing a twin room (limit of one Young Traveler discounts per room). This discount is
 not combinable with the Travel with Friends &amp; Family discount. Savings vary by itinerary. See itinerary pages for exact
 savings and page 24-25 for full details and conditions.</div>
<div><strong>Tour Cancellation:</strong> Trafalgar reserves the right to cancel or re-schedule any tour departure in accordance with operating requirements or circumstances beyond its control. Trafalgar will try to re-book the same or similar tour. If there is a difference in cost, it will be at the guest&apos;s expense. And, where flights have been confirmed by Trafalgar, we will attempt to confirm air seats for new dates selected, subject to availability. If an alternative tour is not accepted by the guest within 7 days, we will refund all monies paid to Trafalgar and will be under no further obligation or liability. Please note that Trafalgar is not liable for any cancellation penalties incurred on any other travel arrangements including air tickets purchased separately from the Trafalgar air-inclusive package or other travel arrangements affected due to our cancellations.</div>
<div><strong>Travel Insurance:</strong> Trafalgar recommends that all guests purchase comprehensive travel insurance. Certain European countries have a requirement for foreign visitors to have valid medical insurance on entry. Trafalgar cannot be held responsible for denied entry should a guest be unable to provide details to the authorities of such insurance.</div><br/>

<div><strong>Passengers who purchase from within California:</strong>Transactions entered into with Trafalgar are covered by the California Travel Consumer Restitution Fund (TCRF) if the passenger is located in California at the time of payment.

The maximum amount which may be paid by the TCRF to any one passenger is the total amount paid on behalf of the passenger to the seller of travel, not to exceed $15,000. A claim must be submitted to the TCRF within 12 months after the scheduled completion date of the travel. A claim must include sufficient documentation to prove your claim and a $35 processing fee.
