Availability of triple rooms is limited and in some hotels may consist of a double bed with a &#8216;roll-away&#8217; bed. Note that single rooms in European hotels are generally smaller than twin-bedded rooms and that European hotel standards, facilities and services provided may vary from those in other parts of the world and are often local in style. Substitute hotels may be used at certain times and will be of similar standard and location whenever possible. There are a limited number of twin-shared rooms available with our Room Share Service. Passengers who are members of Hotel Frequent Traveller programmes are not entitled to earn points with any of the hotels featured on a Trafalgar tour.</div>

Hand luggage should be one piece per person and should be limited in size (not exceeding 30x28x14cm or 12&#8221;x11&#8221;x6&#8221;) so as to fit under your coach seat or in the small overhead shelf. These are the responsibility of each tour member and should be taken on/off the motorcoach with you. <strong>Please note that luggage with telescopic handles and wheels will not fit in the overhead compartments and can therefore not be accepted as carry-on luggage for safety reasons</strong>.</div>

No surcharges regarding cost or currency fluctuations will be made to the LAND only price once the deposit is received. This guarantee however, excludes potential fuel surcharges and does not apply to taxes, charges or levies imposed by any government or its agencies. Airport taxes are subject to change.

Please note that if the total tour price increases by more than 10%, passengers will have the right to cancel their tour within 7 days of notification of the surcharge without penalty. All prices are in US$ unless specified.</div>
			<div><strong>Tour participation:</strong> On all guided holidays children under 5 years are not eligible on coach tours. Children under 18 years of age must be accompanied by an adult. Trafalgar strives to provide a safe, enjoyable and memorable travel experience for all passengers. Trafalgar welcomes passengers with special needs or disabilities. However, please note the following:</div>
			<div>&#8226; Passengers are required to advise Trafalgar, at time of booking, of any physical, medical or other special needs that require accommodating.</div>
			<div>&#8226; All guests must ensure they are medically and physically fit for travel. Trafalgar may impose safety requirements necessary for the safe operation of the tour. Trafalgar may also exclude an individual from participating in a tour or an activity if that individual&apos;s participation poses a direct threat to health or safety.</div>
			<div>&#8226; Trafalgar does not provide personal devices (such as wheelchairs, hearing aids or prescription eye glasses) or services of a personal nature (such as pushing a wheelchair or assistance in eating, toileting or dressing). A companion capable of providing such assistance must accompany any passenger who requires services of a personal nature.</div>
			<div>&#8226; Trafalgar does not employ medical personnel. Any necessary medical attention will be provided by a local facility at the passenger&apos;s expense. Trafalgar is not responsible or liable for any losses or costs incurred as a result of medical services obtained while on tour, or for the quality of the care or services received.</div>
			<div>Passengers should be aware some tours include rough terrain, extensive walking over cobblestone streets, uneven pavement, steps and locations which may not be easily accessible or accessible by wheelchair. During the tour, Trafalgar may make arrangements with carriers, hotels and other independent suppliers to provide travel services. These parties are independent entities over which Trafalgar has no control. Accommodation on international tours may differ from those in your country Trafalgar cannot guarantee disability access or accommodation for passengers travelling on international tour.</div>
			<div>Trafalgar may, in its sole discretion, decline the booking of any passenger or remove any passenger who cannot comply or refuses to comply with Trafalgar&apos;s terms and conditions. Trafalgar is not responsible for any costs incurred in the event a passenger is removed from a tour. Passengers agree not to hold Trafalgar or any of its related entities liable for any actions taken under these terms and conditions.</div>
			<div><strong>Young traveller 5-17 discount:</strong> The young traveller must be under 18 years of age on the tour departure date, and must be accompanied by an adult, sharing a twin room. The young traveller must be the specified age at the time of travel to be eligible for the applicable discount and is limited to one young traveller discount per room. This discount cannot be combined with our Travel With Family and Friends discount. See page 24 - 25 for details.</div>
			<div><strong>Itinerary variations and London Olympics 2012:</strong> Trafalgar constantly strives to improve tour itineraries and features. If such improvements can be made, or unforeseen circumstances beyond our control make changes necessary, we reserve the right to vary itineraries and to substitute hotels. At certain peak periods multiple departures may operate, and sometimes in reverse order, in which case hotels may vary from those stated on the itinerary pages. London Olympics 2012, Religious Festivals, Holidays, Trade fairs (e.g. Amsterdam IBC Congress) or other events (e.g. Venice Film Festival on Lido) occassionally cause changes from scheduled hotels. In these and in other cases substitute hotels may be used and will be of a similar standard and location whenever possible. On tours that include cruises the ship may be changed due to operational reasons. Ports of call on Mediterrannean cruises may be subject to alterations if weather conditions do not permit docking.</div>
			<div>On locally hosted tours, sightseeing and other services may occasionally be provided by third parties in which case transportation and itineraries may vary.</div>
			<div>Trafalgar&apos;s &#8216;Be My Guest&#8217; experiences are unique and take place in singular exclusive locations. In the unlikely event that our local hosts are unable to welcome Trafalgar guests, Trafalgar will attempt to find an alternate experience or a highlight meal will be provided in place of the &#8216;Be My Guest&#8217; experience.</div>
			<div><strong>Holidays &amp; Changes:</strong> During local or national holidays abroad, certain facilities such as museums, sightseeing tours and shopping may be limited. In such instances, and whenever possible, slight itinerary changes are made by Trafalgar to minimise inconvenience to our passengers. If, however, you feel your enjoyment might be diminished by such limitations, please check with the respective national tourist office before selecting a specified departure. Similarly, holidays, closing days and other circumstances may necessitate a change of the day of the week for scheduled highlight dinners, sightseeing or other activities</div>
			<div><strong>Extended stays:</strong> If you have arranged with us to remain at a destination before or after your tour, please understand your stay will be at your sole expense as is the transfer to either the hotel or airport. Regrettably, Trafalgar is unable to provide free transfers for passengers booking pre and post night accommodation in Europe. Additional transfers can be purchased from Trafalgar, please see page 242 for details. Please also be aware if your extra night hotel is not the hotel where your tour begins or ends, you will be responsible for your own transfer arrangements at your own expense.</div>
			<div><strong>For your comfort:</strong> Trafalgar operates a daily seat rotation system and seats on coaches cannot be booked. Also there is a strict nonsmoking policy onboard motorcoaches, but regular comfort stops are made on travelling days.</div>
			<div><strong>Travel insurance:</strong> Trafalgar recommends that all passengers purchase comprehensive travel insurance. Certain European countries have a requirement for foreign visitors to have valid medical insurance on entry. Trafalgar cannot be held responsible if a passenger is denied entry for being unable to provide details to the authorities of such insurance.</div><br/><br/><br/>
