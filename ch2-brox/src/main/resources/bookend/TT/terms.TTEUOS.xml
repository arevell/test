            <Title>WHAT&apos;S INCLUDED IN THE TOUR PRICE</Title>
            <Text>
			<div><strong>Inter-city travel:</strong> By private motorcoach, trains and ferries (see itineraries).</div>
			<div><strong>Motorcoach Travelling:</strong> By air-conditioned/air-ventilated luxury motorcoaches with reclining seats and onboard restroom facilities. Please note that on some regional tours, motorcoaches without toilet facilities are used. In the Middle East, Morocco and South Africa, air-conditioned motorcoaches (or minibuses in Israel &amp; mini/midi coaches South Africa) without toilet facilities are used. South African holidays operate in either a Volkswagen T5 Combi, Toyota Quantum, Mercedes Sprinter or Volare Mini Coach. In the event that there are 15 passengers or fewer in South America (10 passengers or fewer in Australia &amp; New Zealand) travelling on an guided departure, Trafalgar reserves the right to operate this departure on an individual basis with private transfers and individual arrangements; these smaller coaches may feature air-conditioning and reclining seats, but no restroom facilities on board. If due to circumstances beyond our control coaches are used otherwise than as advertised, a refund of &#8364;7 per person will be made.</div>
			<div><strong>Air transportation:</strong> Is only included in the total price where indicated on each specific tour price panel and First Class Travel Highlights.</div>
			<div><strong>Hotel accommodation:</strong> Prices are per person and based on two persons sharing a twin-bedded room with private bath or shower. When booking triple rooms, please note that the third bed may be a &#8216;roll-away&#8217; bed which will limit space in the room. Availability of triple rooms is limited and in some hotels may consist of a double bed with a &#8216;roll-away&#8217; bed. In North America, triple/quad occupancy is based upon three or four people sharing one room with existing bedding arrangements (usually two beds) and does not include the cost of any additional bed or &#8216;roll-away&#8217;. Quad occupancy is not available for four adults sharing. Please also note that availability of triple rooms is limited. In North America, most hotels are now 100% smoke-free. This smoke-free policy includes all guest rooms, restaurants, lounges, meeting rooms, public spaces, and employee work areas. Smoking in a non-smoking room will result in a fine of up to US$350 per room.</div>
			<div>Substitute hotels may be used at certain times and will be of similar standard and location whenever possible (see Itinerary variations below). There are a limited number of twin-shared rooms available with our Guaranteed Room Share Service. Passengers who are members of Hotel Frequent Traveller programmes are not entitled to earn points with any of the hotels featured on a Trafalgar tour.</div>
			<div><strong>Cruises:</strong> Per person prices are based on two persons sharing a cabin with two berths, private shower and toilet. A limited number of single cabins are available at extra cost. For Alaska cruises, triple and quad occupancy is based upon request. On Nile cruises, triple rooms are not available.</div>
			<div><strong>North American cruises:</strong>A hotel service charge of US$11 per passenger is automatically added to each passenger&apos;s shipboard account on a daily basis. If the service exceeds or fails to meet your expectations, you are free to adjust this amount at the end of the cruise.</div>
			<div>Cruise Line Immigration Questionnaire: These mandatory forms are available online with your cruise company and must be completed online no less than 30 days prior to your departure.</div>
			<div>Shore Excursions: To make your holiday even more memorable, cruise lines offer an extension programme of optional shore excursions. Confirmed passengers may confirm shore excursion requests online in advance of sailing.</div>

			<div><strong>Travel Director:</strong> Guided holidays are conducted in English only by a professional multi-lingual Travel Director (English only in Australia, New Zealand &amp; North America). For South Africa, please note that at times we operate our holidays with local guides.</div>
			<div><strong>Meals:</strong> In-flight meals and snacks are served according to airline policy.

Due to limited coach capacity, this single bag <strong>should have dimensions not exceeding 30&#8221;x18&#8221;x10&#8221; (76x46x25cm) and weight not exceeding 50 lbs (23kg)</strong>. Charges will be levied in the event that these limits are exceeded. It cannot be guaranteed that more than one suitcase will be carried. Hand luggage should be one piece per person and should be limited in size (not exceeding 30x28x14cm or 12&#8221;x11&#8221;x6&#8221;) so as to fit under your coach seat or in the small overhead shelf. These are the responsibility of each tour member and should be taken onto the motorcoach with you. <strong>Please note that luggage with telescopic handles and wheels will not fit in the overhead compartments and can therefore not be accepted as carry-on luggage for safety reasons.</strong></div>
			<div>Porterage at train stations is included on certain tours, please refer to individual itinerary pages to see if it is included or not. Trafalgar will not accept liability for any loss or damage to baggage or any of the passenger&apos;s belongings. Passengers should report any lost items to the Travel Director, who will assist in completing a lost/damaged property form that can be used for any insurance claim in this matter. However, Trafalgar cannot assist in locating any lost items once the passenger has returned home.</div>
			<div><strong>Airlines &amp; luggage:</strong>Airlines may impose stricter weight and size limits for luggage and may also charge fees for checked baggage, including the first checked bag. Please check with your airline(s) directly for baggage regulations and related fees. Trafalgar is not responsible for additional fees imposed by air carriers regarding baggage. Note that if taking the Galapagos Islands Extension (pages 76-77), there is a luggage weight restriction of 20kg (44lbs).</div>

            <Title>GENERAL INFORMATION AND CONDITIONS</Title>
            <Text>
			<div><strong>Tour prices:</strong> Are based on costs, charges, tariffs, rates, prices, taxes, levies and exchange rates as at 18 August 2011. Should these change, the price of your holiday may increase. No fuel or currency surcharges will be made (land tours only, does not apply to cruise or air prices) once full deposit payment on your booking is received. This does not apply to any taxes, charges or levies imposed by any government or their agencies. In exchange for these guarantees, no refund will be made if costs are reduced. All prices are in Pound Sterling unless otherwise specified.</div>
			<div>Where holiday prices are surcharged, we will absorb an amount equivalent to 2% of the holiday price which excludes insurance premiums and any amendment charges. Only amounts in excess of this 2% will be surcharged, but where a surcharge is payable, there will be an administration charge of 50p per person, together with the amount to cover the agent&apos;s commission. If this means paying more than 10% on the holiday price, you will be entitled to cancel your holiday with a full refund of all money paid, except for any premium paid to us for holiday insurance and amendment charges. Should you decide to cancel because of this, you must exercise your right to do so within 14 days from the issue date printed on the invoice.</div>
			<div>Should the price of your holiday go down due to the changes mentioned above, by more than 2% of your holiday cost, then any refund due will be paid to you. However, please note that travel arrangements are not always purchased in local currency and some apparent changes have no impact on the price of your travel due to contractual and other protection in place.</div>
			<div><strong>Tour participation:</strong> On all guided holidays children 5 years or younger are not eligible on coach tours. Children under 18 years of age must be accompanied by an adult. For South Africa tours the minimum age is 8 years old with the exception of the Three County Wildlife and Waves Safari where the minimum age is 12 years old and An African Adventure where the minmum age is 5 years old. Trafalgar strives to provide a safe, enjoyable and memorable travel experience for all passengers. Trafalgar welcomes passengers with special needs or disabilities. However, please note the following:</div>
			<div>&#8226; Passengers are required to advise Trafalgar, in advance, of any physical, medical or other special needs that require accommodating.</div>
			<div>&#8226; All guests must ensure they are medically and physically fit for travel. Trafalgar may impose safety requirements necessary for the safe operation of the tour. Trafalgar may also exclude an individual from participating in a tour or an activity if that individual&apos;s participation poses a direct threat to health or safety.</div>
			<div>&#8226; Trafalgar does not provide personal devices (such as wheelchairs, hearing aids or prescription eye glasses) or services of a personal nature (such as pushing a wheelchair or assistance in eating, toileting or dressing). A companion capable of providing such assistance must accompany any passenger who requires services of a personal nature.</div>
			<div>&#8226; Trafalgar does not employ medical personnel. Any necessary medical attention will be provided by a local facility at the passenger&apos;s expense. Trafalgar is not responsible or liable for any losses or costs incurred as a result of medical services obtained while on tour, or for the quality of the care or services received.</div>
			<div>Passengers should be aware some tours include rough terrain, extensive walking over cobblestone streets, uneven pavement, steps and locations which may not be easily accessible or accessible by wheelchair. During the tour, Trafalgar may make arrangements with carriers, hotels and other independent suppliers to provide travel services. These parties are independent entities over which Trafalgar has no control. Accommodation on international tours may differ from those in the UK. Trafalgar cannot guarantee disability access or accommodation for passengers travelling on international tours.</div>
			<div>Trafalgar may, in its sole discretion, decline the booking of any passenger or remove any passenger who cannot comply or refuses to comply with Trafalgar&apos;s terms and conditions. Trafalgar is not responsible for any costs incurred in the event a passenger is removed from a tour. Passengers agree not to hold Trafalgar or any of its related entities liable for any actions taken under these terms and conditions.</div>

			<div><strong>Itinerary variations and London Olympics 2012:</strong> Trafalgar constantly strives to improve tour itineraries and features. If such improvements can be made, or unforeseen circumstances beyond our control make changes necessary, we reserve the right to vary itineraries and to substitute hotels. At certain peak periods duplicate departures may operate, and sometimes in reverse order, in which case hotels may vary from those stated on the itinerary pages. London Olympics 2012, Trade fairs (e.g. Amsterdam IBC Congress) or other events (e.g. Venice Film Festival on Lido) occasionally cause changes from scheduled hotels. In these and in other cases substitute hotels may be used and will be of a similar standard and location whenever possible.</div>
			<div>On tours that include cruises, the ship may be changed due to operational reasons. Ports of call on Mediterranean cruises may be subject to alterations if weather conditions do not permit docking.</div>
			<div>On locally-hosted tours, sightseeing and other services may occasionally be provided by third parties, in which case transportation and itineraries may vary.</div>
			<div>Departures in early/late season are potentially operated in cool weather conditions. As a result, slight itinerary variations may occur, and certain activities may not be available due to seasonality or weather conditions. If your tour enjoyment may be diminished by such limitations, please check with your Travel Agent before making your reservation.</div>
			<div>Trafalgar&apos;s &#8216;Be My Guest&#8217; experiences are unique and take place in singular exclusive locations. In the unlikely event that our local hosts are unable to welcome Trafalgar guests, Trafalgar will attempt to find an alternate experience or a highlight meal will be provided in place of the &#8216;Be My Guest&#8217; experience.</div>
			<div><strong>Holidays &amp; Changes:</strong> During local or national holidays abroad, certain facilities such as museums, sightseeing tours and shopping may be limited. In such instances, and whenever possible, slight itinerary changes are made by Trafalgar to minimize inconvenience to our passengers. If, however, you feel your enjoyment might be diminished by such limitations, please check with the respective national tourist office before selecting a specific departure. Similarly, holidays, closing days and other circumstances may necessitate a change of the day of the week for scheduled sightseeing or other activities.</div>
			<div><strong>Extended stays:</strong> If you have arranged extra night accommodation with us at a destination before or after your tour, please understand your stay will be at your sole expense, as is the transfer from or to the airport.</div>
			<div><strong>For your comfort:</strong> Trafalgar operates a daily seat rotation system and seats on coaches cannot be booked. Also a strict non-smoking policy onboard motorcoaches applies but regular comfort stops are made on travelling days.</div>
			<div><strong>Tour cancellation:</strong> Trafalgar reserves the right to cancel or re-schedule any tour departure in accordance with operating requirements or circumstances beyond its control. Trafalgar will, whenever possible, offer an alternative tour of similar standard. If there is a difference in cost, it will be at the passengers&apos; expense. If an alternative tour is not accepted by the tour participant within operating deadlines, we will refund all monies paid to Trafalgar and will be under no further obligation or liability. Trafaglar is not responsible for any additional costs/penalties incurred, ontravel arrangements and air tickets purchased separately from the &#8216;Air and Land&#8217; inclusive package.</div>
			<div><strong>Trafalgar is not responsible</strong> for any other travel arrangements affected due to our cancellations including air tickets purchased separately from the air-inclusive booking.</div>
			<div><strong>Travel insurance:</strong> Trafalgar recommends that all passengers purchase comprehensive travel insurance. Some countries have a requirement for foreign visitors to have valid medical insurance on entry. Trafalgar cannot be held responsible if a passenger is denied entry for being unable to provide details to the authorities of such insurance.</div>
