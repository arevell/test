	<div><strong>Inter-city Travel:</strong> By private motorcoach, trains and ferries (see itineraries).</div>
	<div><strong>Touring:</strong> By air-conditioned luxury motorcoaches. Please note that on some Regional Tours and London sightseeing, motorcoaches without toilet facilities are used. In the Middle East, air-conditioned motorcoaches (or minibuses in Israel) without toilet facilities are used. If due to circumstances beyond our control coaches are used otherwise than as advertised, a refund of C$10 per person will be made.</div>

When booking triple rooms please note that in some hotels may consist of one double bed and the third bed may be a &#8216;roll-away&#8217; bed which will limit space in the room. Availability of triple rooms is limited. Note that single rooms in European hotels are generally smaller than twin-bedded rooms and that European hotel standards, facilities and services provided may vary from those in other parts of the world and are often local in style. Substitute hotels may be used at certain times and will be of similar standard whenever possible. There are a limited number of twin-shared rooms available with our Room Share Service. Passengers who are members of Hotel Frequent Traveler programs are not entitled to earn points with any of the hotels featured on a Trafalgar vacation.</div>
	<div><strong>Cruises:</strong> Per person prices are based on two persons sharing a cabin with two berths, private shower and toilet. A limited number of single cabins are available at extra cost. On Nile cruises, triple rooms are not available.</div>
	<div><strong>Travel Director:</strong> Guided vacations are conducted in English only by a professional multi-lingual Travel Director. On some City Breaks there may be a Local Host instead of a Travel Director. Please refer to individual itinerary pages.</div>

Continental or buffet breakfast on all tours except in Ireland, provincial Britain (not including London) and Scandinavia where full national style breakfasts are served.

	<div><strong>Porterage &amp; Luggage Allowance:</strong> Baggage handling for one suitcase per person on tour, at hotels, is included in the tour price.

Due to limited coach capacity, this single bag <strong>should have dimensions not exceeding 30&#34;x18&#34;x10&#34; (76x46x25cm) and weight not exceeding 50 lbs (23kg).</strong> A charge of US&#36;3 per traveling day will be collected by the Travel Director if a second piece of baggage is carried, or if the suitcase exceeds the established weight and/or dimensions. However it cannot be guaranteed that more than one suitcase will be carried. Hand luggage should be one piece per person and should be limited in size (not exceeding 30x28x14cm or 12&#34;x11&#34;x6&#34;) so as to fit under your coach seat or in the small overhead shelf. These are the responsibility of each tour member and should be taken onto the motorcoach with you. <strong>Please note that luggage with telescopic handles and wheels will not fit in the overhead compartments and can therefore not be accepted as carry-on luggage for safety reasons.</strong><br /> Trafalgar will not accept liability for any loss or damage to baggage or any of the passenger&apos;s belongings. Passengers should report any lost items to the Travel Director who will assist in completing a lost property form that can be used for any insurance claim in this matter. However, Trafalgar cannot assist in locating any lost items once the passenger has returned home.<br /> Airlines may impose stricter weight and size limits for luggage and may also charge fees for checked baggage, including the first checked bag.

In order to process your tour booking, Trafalgar will need to use personal information for you and other passengers included in your booking, which may include each passenger&apos;s name, address, phone number, email address, passport number, credit/debit card number and sensitive information such as health, medical, dietary, mobility, religious or other special requirements. This personal information may be passed on to other suppliers for your travel arrangements in addition to public authorities (such as customs and immigration), security and credit checking organizations, and otherwise as required by law. Similarly, we may also need to provide personal information to contractors who provide services to or for us (such as sending mail, processing payments, providing marketing assistance). This may involve sending personal information (including sensitive information) to other countries that may not afford the same level of protection of personal information. 2. We may also use the personal information you provide us to review and improve the tours and services that we offer, and to contact you (by post, email and/or phone) about other tours and services offered by Trafalgar that you may be interested in. If you don&apos;t want to receive this information or want a copy of the personal information we hold about you, write to us at Trafalgar Tours of Canada Ltd, Attn. Marketing Department, 33 Kern Road, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M3B 1S9. Trafalgar may charge a fee for supplying you with this information as permitted by law.</div>
