</div>
<div>NB: Please note, Contiki’s cancellation policy is different in Asia due to internal flight ticketing timeframes &amp; ground transport confirmations. These must be booked well in advance in order to secure high quality services that adhere to our strict safety standards. Where the percentage cancellation fee is less than the trip deposit, the cancellation fee will equal loss of deposit. If the reason for cancellation falls within the terms of any holiday insurance policy which you hold, then any such charges may, subject to the terms of your insurance policy, be refunded to you by the insurance company.
</div>
<div>3.4 Any cancellation of additional services within 14 days from date of service, such as pre &amp; post accommodation &amp; transfers, will incur a 100% cancellation fee. For cancellation of additional services outside of 14 days from date of service, please refer to the above cancellation policy.
</div>
<div>3.5 In the event that you should not be granted a visa, we have devised this unique scheme to protect you against the necessary cancellation fees detailed above. For trips costing up to US$1,000 - waiver fee US$79 per person. For trips costing over US$1,000 - waiver fee US$89 per person. Waiver fees are payable at the time of booking and are non-refundable. They do not apply to cancellations due to changes of mind or for medical reasons. To protect yourself against these and other eventualities, you should ask your Travel Agent about a suitable insurance policy. N.B. This scheme is applicable only in the event that you provide documentary proof of having a visa application refused. To be eligible for the purchase of the visa waiver insurance, clients are encouraged to do so as early as possible when they make their trip booking.  If we do not hear from you or your travel agent 30 days before the trip, we will assume that your visa application has not been approved and we will have to cancel your reservation. However, you can always re-book your trip (subject to availability) should your visa approval come inside 30 days. Bookings made within 30 days without the necessary visa approvals are not eligible for this visa waiver insurance and will be subject to the standard cancellation terms and conditions.
</div>
<div>3.6 Any cancellation of additional services booked prior to &amp; after your trip booking, such as pre &amp; post accommodation &amp; transfers, that are cancelled within 14 days of the trip departure incur a 100% cancellation fee.
</div>
<div>3.7 These cancellation fees are in addition to any cancellation fees that may be levied by your travel agent. All Cancellation policies valid as at 24th October, 2014, and are subject to change. Final policy will be confirmed at time of booking.
</div>
<div>3.8 If flight changes are requested after the deposit has been received, or if flights are cancelled after tickets are issued, revision fees, change fees or Airline cancellation fees will be applicable and maybe in addition to the above cancellation charges.
</div>
<div>4. IF YOU CHANGE YOUR BOOKING
</div>
<div>4.1 If after your booking has been confirmed, you wish to change to an alternative departure date, transfer your booking to someone else who satisfies all the conditions applicable to the package or you wish to change to a different Contiki holiday, you may do so subject to a period of reasonable notice and provided the new holiday date is also in this brochure and is available.
</div>
<div>4.2 A fee of US$30 per person will be charged for any revision or alteration made to a reservation after the booking is confirmed unless the change increases the value of the booking. A change of trip date or trip itinerary within 45 days of departure will be treated as a cancellation, and normal cancellation fees will apply except when the change is to an earlier departure date of equivalent or greater value in which case a US$30 per person amendment fee will be charged.
</div>
<bold>5. HOLIDAY DETAILS AND CONDITIONS
</bold>
