<bold>1. YOUR HOLIDAY RESERVATION</bold>
<div>
On receipt of your deposit, subject to availability and at our discretion, Contiki will reserve your place on your selected holiday. A contract is made between you and Contiki Holidays Limited (Registered in Guernsey No. 50681 (Contiki)) only upon your booking being confirmed and accepted by us and our communication thereof to you or your travel agent. 
</div>
<bold>2. YOUR FINANCIAL PROTECTION</bold>
<div>
Contiki are a member of ABTA and hold ATOL Number 10144 issued by the Civil Aviation Authority, which provide for your protection in the event of our insolvency. Only bookings from countries subject to the EC Package Travel Directive will receive ﬁnancial protection from ABTA &amp; CAA. Many of the ﬂights and ﬂight-inclusive holidays in this brochure are ﬁnancially protected by the ATOL scheme. But ATOL protection does not apply to all holiday and travel services listed in this brochure. Please ask us to conﬁrm what protection may apply to your booking. If you do not receive an ATOL Certiﬁcate then the booking will not be ATOL protected. If you do receive an ATOL Certiﬁcate but all the parts of your trip are not listed on it, those parts will not be ATOL protected. Please see our booking conditions for information, or for more information about ﬁnancial protection and the ATOL Certiﬁcate go to: http://www.atol.org.uk/ATOLCertiﬁcate When you buy an ATOL protected ﬂight or ﬂight inclusive holiday from us you will receive an ATOL Certiﬁcate. This lists what is ﬁnancially protected, where you can get information on what this means for you and who to contact if things go wrong. We, or the suppliers identiﬁed on your ATOL Certiﬁcate, will provide you with the services listed on the ATOL Certiﬁcate (or a suitable alternative). In some cases, where neither we nor the supplier are able to do so for reasons of insolvency, an alternative ATOL holder may provide you with the services you have bought or a suitable alternative (at no extra cost to you). You agree to accept that in those circumstances the alternative ATOL holder will perform those obligations and you agree to pay any money outstanding to be paid by you under your contract to that alternative ATOL holder. However, you also agree that in some cases it will not be possible to appoint an alternative ATOL holder, in which case you will be entitled to make a claim under the ATOL scheme (or your credit card issuer where applicable). If we, or the suppliers identiﬁed on your ATOL certiﬁcate, are unable to provide the services listed (or a suitable alternative, through an alternative ATOL holder or otherwise) for reasons of insolvency, the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust may make a payment to (or confer a beneﬁt on) you under the ATOL scheme. You agree that in return for such a payment or beneﬁt you assign absolutely to those Trustees any claims which you have or may have arising out of or relating to the non-provision of the services, including any claim against us, the travel agent (or your credit card issuer where applicable). You also agree that any such claims may be re-assigned to another body, if that other body has paid sums you have claimed under the ATOL scheme. Any monies paid to us for non-licensable products (accommodation and packages which do not include ﬂight elements) are protected by means of a bond held by us with ABTA. This means that if, in the unlikely event of our insolvency, the accommodation or package cannot be provided, the client will receive their money back or, if their stay has started, arrangements will be made for them to be able to continue as planned. 
</div>
<bold>3. PRICE GUARANTEE</bold>
<div>
Prices on this site are based on costs and exchange rates as of: 3rd April 2014 - USA &amp; Canada, 4th July 2014 - Europe &amp; UK, 6th March 2014 - Europe &amp; UK (Winter), 7th August 2014 - Asia, 8th January 2014 - Australia &amp; New Zealand and 21st March 2014 - Latin America. No surcharge in respect of costs or currency fluctuations will be made within 30 days of the commencement of the land content of any holiday or once payment of the deposit of your land tour has been received. The price of your travel arrangements can be varied due to changes in transportation costs such as fuel, scheduled airfares and any other airline cost changes which are part of the contract between airlines (and their agents) and the tour operator or organiser. The price of your travel arrangements can also be varied due to government action such as changes in VAT or any other government imposed changes and currency changes in relation to an exchange rate variation.In the case of any small variation, an amount equivalent to 2% of the price of your travel arrangements, which excludes any amendment charges, will be absorbed or retained. For larger variations this 2% will still be absorbed for increases but not retained from refunds. Should the price of your holiday go down, by more than 2% of your holiday cost, then any refund due will be paid to you. However, please note that travel arrangements are not always purchased in local currency and some apparent changes have no impact on the price of your travel due to contractual and other protection in place. In either case there will be an administration charge of £1.00 per person together with an amount to cover agents’ commission. If this means that you have to pay an increase of more than 10% of the price of your travel arrangements, you may cancel your travel arrangements and receive a full refund of all monies paid, except for any amendment charges. Should you decide to cancel for this reason, you must exercise your right to do so within 14 days from the issue date printed on your final invoice. Whether you cancel or not you will also be entitled, on the terms set out in respect of major changes in clause 4.3 below, to accept an offer of alternative travel arrangements from us if we are able to do so.
</div>
<bold>4.IF WE CANCEL OR CHANGE YOUR HOLIDAY</bold>
<div>
</div>
<div>4.1 Contiki reserves the right to change or cancel your booking in accordance with operating requirements or circumstances beyond its control.
</div>
<div>4.2 Should change or cancellation prove necessary we will give you reasonable notice thereof, in the circumstances, and where available, offer you a comparable alternative. Where cancellation is necessary, a minimum period of 45 days notice will be given by us unless the circum-stances leading to the cancellation were beyond our reasonable control.
</div>
<div>4.3 If an alternative is not available or acceptable you will be entitled to either a full refund of monies paid by you to us or transfer to another Contiki holiday without payment of any transfer fee.
</div>
<div>4.4 If the change or cancellation is due to force majeure (i.e. circumstances like political unrest, war or threat of war, riots, civil strife, closure of airports or ports, industrial disputes, terrorist activity, natural and nuclear disasters, fire, epidemic or health risk, Acts of God, adverse weather conditions or other similar events beyond Contiki’s control) we will give a full refund of any monies paid to us less reasonable expenses incurred by us in respect of your booking. 
</div>
<div>4.5 Contiki is not responsible for the cost of any other travel arrangements affected due to cancellation or the rescheduling of any holiday.
</div>

In the event of failure, any money held at that time by the agent, or subsequently accepted from you by them, is and continues to be held on behalf of and for the benefit of the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust without any obligation to pay that money to us.
</div>
<div>Full payment for International flights (excluding those which are included in and not in addition to your chosen holiday) must be remitted at time of booking or within 7 days depending on the airlines ticketing deadline and is non-refundable, non-transferable and non-changeable.

</div>
<div>6.3 All monies paid by you to us through your travel agent or otherwise, whether in respect of the deposit or full payment, may be disbursed by us as and when we see fit, in respect of the services to be provided and/or fees payable under your selected holiday.

We do not tolerate the possession or carriage of illegal or restricted substances (drugs). Furthermore, you agree that your fellow travellers and any Contiki Representative have the right to travel/work in a safe environment. Any threats to their safety, well being or inappropriate behavior by you, whether verbal or physical, will be taken extremely seriously and may result in the immediate termination of your holiday. In such event, you will be responsible for your own repatriation and related costs and have no claims against us.

We rely on international convention, national &amp; international law which may apply to the services provided by us, our suppliers or agents with respect to any claim of any nature brought by you against us as a result of the provision of those services. International conventions which apply may include: Warsaw Convention 1929, (as amended by Hague Protocol and Montreal Protocol) in relation to air travel, or Montreal Convention; the Berne Convention for rail travel; Athens Convention 1974 for carriage by sea; the Geneva Convention for carriage by road and the Paris Convention 1962 for Hotels. We are to be regarded as having all benefit of these conventions on limiting our liability in relation to any claim for death, injury, loss, damage and delay to passengers and luggage.

<bold>2. ARBITRATION</bold>
<div>
Disputes arising out of, or in connection with, this contract which cannot be amicably settled, may be referred to arbitration, if the customer so wishes, under a special scheme arranged by the Association of British Travel Agents, and administered independently by the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators. The scheme provides for a simple and inexpensive method of arbitration on documents alone with restricted liability on the customer in respect of costs. Full details will be provided on request or can be obtained from the ABTA website (www.abta.com). The scheme does not apply to claims for an amount greater than £5,000 per person. There is also a limit of £25,000 per booking form. Neither does it apply to claims, which are solely in respect of physical injury or illness or their consequences. The scheme can however deal with compensation claims which include an element of minor injury or illness subject to a limit of £1,000 on the amount the arbitrator can award per person in respect of this element. The application for arbitration and Statement of Claim must be received by the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators within twelve months of the date of return from the holiday. Outside this time limit arbitration under the Scheme may still be available if the company agrees, but the ABTA code does not require such agreement.
