            <Text>
<bold>1. YOUR VACATION RESERVATION</bold>
<div>
On receipt of your deposit, subject to availability and at our discretion, Contiki will reserve your place on your selected vacation. A contract is only made between you and us upon your booking being confirmed and accepted by us and our communication thereof to either you or your travel agent. 
</div>
<bold>2. PRICE GUARANTEE
</bold>
<div>a) Trip Prices: Are based on costs, tariffs, taxes, charges, levies and exchange rates in the appropriate operating region as of, and are applicable from: 5th April 2013 - The Americas, July 31st 2013 - Europe &amp; UK, March 18th 2013 - Europe &amp; UK (Winter), 7th August 2014 - Asia and February 27th 2013 - Australia &amp; New Zealand. Should these change, the price of your vacation may increase. If the total price increases by more than 10%, you may cancel, without penalty, within 3 DAYS after we notify you of the increase. Except as explained below, we will not increase the price of your land vacation after we receive your full deposit for your land vacation. In exchange for this guarantee, no refund will be made if the cost factors described above are reduced.
</div>
<div>b) Airline Fuel Surcharges, Air-Related Taxes, Fees and Restrictions, and levies imposed by any government or its agencies: All quoted land and air prices include airline fuel surcharges and Air-Related Taxes and Fees, applicable as of the dates noted above. However, if the customer is notified of the potential for a price increase and we have received the customer’s written or verbal consent prior to accepting any payment, we reserve the right to recover from you increases in those surcharges. Any additional fees charged by the airlines, such as baggage handling, seat selections, and/or any other services are the sole responsibility of the passenger(s). Additional air-related restrictions apply. 
</div>
<bold>3. IF WE CANCEL OR CHANGE YOUR VACATION
</bold>
<div>3.1 Contiki reserves the right to change or cancel any trip departure in accordance with operating requirements or circumstances beyond its control.
</div>
<div>3.2 If a cancellation is made any time prior to the trip departure*, Contiki’s only liability will be to refund the passenger the amount it has received for the booking. Contiki will try and re-book the same or a similar trip and, where flights have been confirmed by Contiki, will attempt to confirm air seats for the new date selected, subject to availability. Contiki is not liable for any changes, amendment or cancellation penalties incurred on any other travel arrangements purchased separately.
</div>
<div>3.3 If an alternative trip is not available or acceptable you will be entitled to either a full refund of monies paid by you to us or transfer to another Contiki vacation without payment of any transfer fee. *Please Note: The departure date constitutes the date indicated on Contiki’s invoice. If you do not join the trip on the day of departure then cancellation fees will be 100%.
</div>
<div>3.4 If the change or cancellation is due to force majeure (i.e. circumstances like political unrest, war or threat of war, riots, civil strife, closure of airports or ports, industrial disputes, terrorist activity, natural and nuclear disasters, fire, epidemic or health risk, Acts of God, adverse weather conditions or other similar events beyond Contiki’s control) we will give a full refund of any monies paid to us less reasonable expenses incurred by us in respect of your booking.
</div>
<div>3.5 Contiki is not responsible for the costs of any other travel arrangements affected due to our cancellations or rescheduling of any trip departure.
</div>
<bold>4. VACATION DETAILS AND CONDITIONS
</bold>
<div>4.1 The information in our brochure is correct to the best of our knowledge at the time of going to print (May 2013 - The Americas, October 2013 - Europe &amp; UK, June 2013 - Europe &amp; UK (Winter), October 2014 - Asia and February 2014 - Australia &amp; New Zealand) but we cannot guarantee that any item or amenity mentioned will be available, especially where we have no direct control over it.
</div>
<div>4.2 With respect to Contiki’s touring program Contiki will do our best, at our discretion, to select accommodations, sightseeing trips and transportation to give you good value for your money.
</div>
<div>4.3 Contiki constantly strives to improve trip itineraries and features. If such improvements can be made, or unforeseen circumstances beyond our control make changes necessary, we reserve the right to vary itineraries and to substitute hotels. Contiki is not responsible for any other travel arrangements affected due to our cancellations.
</div>
<div>4.4 Any special meal requirements will be made on a request basis only. Contiki cannot guarantee special meal requests nor will assume any responsibility or liability if clients’ special meal requests are not fulfilled.
</div>
<bold>5. LIABILITY
</bold>
<div>5.1 Contiki is responsible for properly arranging and conducting your vacation.
</div>
<div>5.2 As a Trip Operator, Contiki makes arrangements with carriers, hoteliers and other independent suppliers to provide you with some or all of the travel services you purchase. These parties are independent suppliers over whom Contiki has no direct control. Unless caused by its own negligence, Contiki is not responsible for and accepts no liability in respect of any claims, losses, damages, costs or expenses arising out of:
</div>
<div>a) personal injury, sickness, disease, accident or death, however caused, including without limitation, where same results from your conduct on vacation.
</div>
<div>b) loss or damage to or delay of baggage or other property unless resulting from Contiki’s negligence in which case Contiki’s liability shall be limited to the actual loss but in no event would exceed the total vacation cost;
</div>
<div>c) delays and loss as a result of government action, weather, mechanical breakdown, equipment failure, labor disputes, sickness, acts of war, insurrection, terrorism, Acts of God or any other causes beyond Contiki’s direct control. Contiki cannot be responsible for interruption of air carrier service due to airline default.
</div>
<div>d) acts or omissions, whether negligent or otherwise, of suppliers of services or their personnel (including, without limitation, transportation and accommodation services) or of any other person or body unless such a person or body is employed by us, or is an agent of ours, and is acting within the scope of his or her authority. In no event is Contiki liable for the acts or omissions of independent third party contractors or of its own employees or agents acting outside the scope of their duties.
</div>
<div>e) loss of enjoyment, upset, disappointment, distress or frustration, whether physical or mental, resulting from any of the following:
</div>
<div>(i) any matter or topic described in sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) inclusive above.
</div>
<div>(ii) your failure to obtain the necessary documentation to travel.
</div>
<div>(iii) your failure to arrive on time for initial departure or for connections within the trip or to stay within or join your trip at any time after initial departure.
</div>
<div>(iv) your leaving the trip prior to its completion.
</div>
<div>(v) the need for Contiki to change itineraries or substitute accommodation or services, provided that Contiki makes every effort to supply the most comparable services and accommodations available.
</div>
<div>(vi) cancellation of the vacation by Contiki provided that a full refund of all monies paid is made to you.
</div>
<div>(vii) Many of our activities are action and adventure orientated. Sports and similar activities inherently involve risks of injury greater than those that would be encountered if you were not participating in such, and therefore, by voluntarily taking part in any sports or other such activities, you thereby acknowledge and assume any of the risks inherent therein. In the absence of negligence on our part, or on the part of our agents and representatives, neither we nor they accept any responsibility for, and shall not be liable for, any injury, illness, damage, loss, accident, expense, delay or any other irregularity resulting from your participation in any of the activities made available to you.
</div>
<div>(viii) We take every reasonable precaution possible to assure your comfort, safety, and enjoyment while you are taking part in a Contiki vacation. Contiki vacations are generally for the young, and not for the frail or those not generally enjoying good health. A change of climate, food, time and varied cultural habits often affects travelers differently. We therefore recommend that you advise your doctor that you are taking one of our vacations and ask if he or she recommends anything for your trip, even for something as seemingly benign as an upset stomach. Since the brands of any medication to which you are accustomed may be unavailable in places to which you are traveling, we recommend you bring your own supply of any medication you will require and carry such medication in your hand luggage. Prescription drugs should be carried in the original labeled bottles. Should you fall ill during your Contiki vacation, we will make every reasonable effort to make prompt, sanitary, safe and proper medical care available to you. However, if at anytime or anywhere treatments of any sort are suggested to you that do not meet your needs or expectations, you should not hesitate to contact your own doctor. Also, please note that the same sorts of activities that can expose you to certain types of diseases at home can just as easily expose you to those same diseases abroad. This information is provided only for your convenience and we are not responsible or liable for any damages resulting from your failure to confirm or ascertain health information or medical precaution, if any, for the places which you will be visiting. 
</div>
<div>(ix) Contiki is responsible for taking care to arrange and conduct your vacation properly. With you in mind, we have accepted applications from and interviewed numerous potential employees, and then we select only those people whom we believe in our best judgement would be responsible and congenial, Trip Managers, Representatives and Drivers. Although we firmly believe, based on personal interviews and certain disclosures made to us by our employees, that all of our employees enjoy excellent health, we, like other trip operators, are legally unable to confirm this in most, if not all, instances.

        <Section2>
            <Title>Your Responsibilities</Title>
            <Text>
<bold>1. BOOKING YOUR VACATION
</bold>
<div>1.1 In order to reserve your vacation, a deposit of US$200, per person per trip, or the full amount payable if booking is made within 45 days of departure, must be submitted to Contiki by you in respect of that vacation. This payment is in addition to any deposit required by your travel agent. The deposit is accepted as a first installment of the vacation price by Contiki only once the booking has been confirmed in writing by Contiki or your travel agent. In addition to the land deposit, a non-refundable air deposit of $300 per person is due at the time of booking. By paying this deposit, the air and land price is protected against any future increases. If paying by a third-party credit card your Contiki specialist will provide you a third-party authorization form that must be completely filled out and received by Contiki before payment can be received.
</div>
<div>1.2 Your land reservation will be confirmed on receipt of a non-transferable, non-refundable deposit of US$200 per person for the first trip booked and then a deposit of US$200 for second and subsequent trips booked at the time of booking or the reservation will automatically be cancelled.
</div>
<div>1.3 To reserve your airfare, a non-refundable and non-transferable deposit of US$350 per person is required at time of booking. Once your airfare is confirmed and Contiki has received your air and land deposit, your air-inclusive price is guaranteed. Contiki reserves the right to issue your ticket based upon receipt of your land and air deposit. Any subsequent changes and/or revisions to your airline reservation after receipt of your deposit is subject to revision fees and/or airline-imposed change or cancellation fees. These fees are a minimum of US$350, and in some instances may be up to 100% of the ticket price.
</div>
<bold>2. PAYING THE BALANCE
</bold>
<div>2.1 The balance of the vacation price must be paid by no later than 45 days before your scheduled vacation departure date which shall be by the due date stated on the confirmation issued to you by Contiki.
</div>
<div>2.2 Air Payment: Payment in full for your airfare booked in conjunction with your Contiki vacation may be required at time of booking for Europe, UK, Latin America and Asia trips, and is required at time of booking for Australia, New Zealand, USA &amp; Canada trips. The Department of Transportation now requires Contiki to inform you of the following conditions.  The package price is subject to change until it has been paid in full.  When this happens, it is usually the result of increases in fuel surcharges and or government taxes.  You must consent to the possibility that, until you pay for your package in full, your price could go up.  Once you have paid in full we would only pass along increases in government taxes if applicable at that time.  You have 7 days from receipt of the first invoice to revoke your consent and request a refund, at which time we would cancel your booking.
</div>
<div>2.3 If payment isn’t made by the due date, Contiki may assume that you have cancelled and cancellation charges in accordance with clause 3 below will be levied by Contiki.
</div>
<div>2.4 Tickets and other documents will not be forwarded until full payment has been received by Contiki.
</div>
<div>2.5 In the case of Late Bookings made within 45 days of your departure, the full cost of the vacation will be payable immediately on booking.  Documents can be emailed to the passenger at no additional charge or passenger can pay a US$35 expedited shipping fee for physical documents.  
</div>
<div>2.6 Contiki reserves the right to cancel the booking and apply cancellation charges should payments not be received within the above specified periods.
</div>
<div>2.7 Travel documents will be sent to you approximately 21 days prior to trip departure* (providing full payment has been received). However, if travel documents are required the next day or earlier than 21 days prior to departure* (providing full payment has been received), a fee of US$35 per mailing will apply. Any documents delivered outside the USA will incur a minimum fee of US$50. The actual cost will be advised at time of booking.
</div>
<bold>3. IF YOU CANCEL
</bold>
<div>3.1 If notice of cancellation is received by Contiki 46 days prior to trip departure*, the non-refundable, non-transferable deposit will be retained along with the Travel Protection.
</div>
<div>3.2 Notice of cancellation must be made in writing directly to Contiki.
</div>

</div>
<div>NB: Please note, Contiki’s cancellation policy is different in Asia due to internal flight ticketing timeframes &amp; ground transport confirmations. These must be booked well in advance in order to secure high quality services that adhere to our strict safety standards. Where the percentage cancellation fee is less than the trip deposit, the cancellation fee will equal loss of deposit. If the reason for cancellation falls within the terms of any vacation insurance policy which you hold, then any such charges may, subject to the terms of your insurance policy, be refunded to you by the insurance company.
</div>
<bold>AIR ARRANGEMENTS
</bold>
<div>These cancellation charges apply for airline arrangements made by Contiki: Prior to final payment a service fee of - US$50 per person.
</div> 
<div>After final payment a service fee of - US$75 per person plus any airline imposed penalties which may be up to 100% of the air ticket value.
</div>
<div>3.4 Any cancellation of additional services within 14 days from date of service, such as pre &amp; post accommodation &amp; transfers, will incur a 100% cancellation fee. For cancellation of additional services outside of 14 days from date of service, please refer to the above cancellation policy.
</div>
<div>3.5 These cancellation fees are in addition to any cancellation fees that may be levied by your Travel Agent. All cancellation policies valid as at 29th October 2014 and are subject to change. Final policy will be confirmed at time of booking.
</div>
<div>3.6 Please note that Contiki is not liable for any cancellation penalties incurred on any other travel arrangements including air tickets purchased separately from the air and land included package. 
</div>
<div>* Please note: the departure date constitutes the date indicated on Contiki’s confirmation
</div>
<bold>4. IF YOU CHANGE YOUR BOOKING
</bold>
<div>4.1 If after your booking has been confirmed, you wish to change to an alternative departure date or you wish to change to a different Contiki vacation, you may do so subject to availability and provided the new vacation date is also in this brochure.
</div>
<div>4.2 A fee of US$30 per person will be charged for any revision or alteration made to a reservation after the booking is confirmed. Any alterations risk the loss of air space or increased airfares. Name changes or corrections will be treated as a cancellation of air and all normal air cancellation fees will apply. A change of trip date or trip itinerary within 45 days of trip departure will be treated as a cancellation, and normal cancellation fees will apply except when the change is to an earlier departure date of equivalent or greater value in which case a US$30 per person amendment fee will be charged.
</div>
<bold>5. VACATION DETAILS AND CONDITIONS
</bold>
<div>5.1 Please read the brochure carefully for those items included in the price. No allowance or refund can be made for meals, accommodation, excursions, etc. that you elect not to take, or when museums, shops, etc. are closed. Hotel facilities may vary from place to place. Meals may vary in style.
</div>
<div>5.2 Contiki’s vacations are specifically planned for those in the 18- 35 age group. Consequently the facilities and activities on a Contiki trip are not appropriate to persons outside this age bracket. If you have a question regarding the age groups, you should discuss this thoroughly with Contiki staff personnel.
</div>
<div>5.3 Contiki strives to provide a safe, enjoyable and memorable travel experience for all passengers. Contiki welcomes passengers with special needs or disabilities. However, please note the following:
</div>
<div>• Passengers are required to advise Contiki, in advance, of any physical, medical or other special needs that require accommodation.  A special needs form must be completed prior to final payment. 
</div>
<div>• All guests must ensure they are medically and physically fit for travel. Contiki may impose safety requirements necessary for the safe operation of the trip. Contiki may also exclude an individual from participating in a trip or an activity if that individual’s participation poses a direct threat to health or safety.
</div>
<div>• Contiki does not provide personal devices (such as wheelchairs, hearing aids or prescription eye glasses) or services of a personal nature (such as pushing a wheelchair or assistance in eating, toileting or dressing). A companion capable of providing such assistance must accompany any passenger who requires services of a personal nature.
</div>
<div>• Contiki does not employ medical personnel. Any necessary medical attention will be provided by a local facility at the passenger’s expense. Contiki is  not responsible or liable for any losses or costs incurred as a result of  medical services obtained while on a trip, or for the quality of the care or services received.
</div>
<div>• Passengers should be aware some trips include rough terrain, extensive walking over cobblestone streets, uneven pavement, steps and locations which may not be easily accessible or accessible by wheelchair. During the trip, Contiki may make arrangements with carriers, hotels and other independent suppliers to provide travel services. These parties are independent entities over which Contiki has no control. Accommodations on international trips may differ from those in the United States. Contiki cannot guarantee disability access or accommodations for passengers traveling on international trips.
