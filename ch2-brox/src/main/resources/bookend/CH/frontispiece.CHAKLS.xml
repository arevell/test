			Live life on your own terms – create the stories now

			<br/><br/><br/>
			Make new friends from new places
			<br/><br/><br/>
			Travel a lot. It’s the only thing you’ll buy that’ll

			<br/><br/><br/>
			Celebrate individuality, diversity, connections &amp;
			a little bit of craziness
			<br/><br/><br/>
			Find comfort outside your comfort zone

			See the world through youthful eyes, a little bit of

			Live for the moment. Have #NOREGRETS, just

		<title>The Contiki Difference</title>
		<image>CHAKLS/Page03-image-lores.jpg</image>
		<block>
			<title col="black">CHOICE, CHOICE &amp; MORE CHOICE</title>
			<text><![CDATA[As the original travel company for 18-35s we have perfected the art of knowing who our travellers are & what they want. The most important thing we know: no two travellers are the same. So, with this in mind, we thought we’d mix it up with a range of different travel experiences in addition to more itineraries & destinations than anyone else (we run more departure dates too). What’s more, you get more free time (we call it ME Time) giving you total freedom & flexibility. In short – we’ll make sure you have nothing but choice when you travel with Contiki. Check out our 8 ways to travel on contiki.com to find out what travel style will suit your adventure best.]]></text>

			<title col="black">WHO YOU’LL TRAVEL WITH</title>
			<text><![CDATA[With Contiki you’ll only ever travel with other 18-35 years old. As much as we love our grannies we don’t really want to spend our days exploring with them. We want to explore the world with other young adventurers – couples, solo travellers & groups of friends. About 50% of our travellers set off alone & we don’t charge for SINGLE SUPPLEMENTS. We will simply match you up with a same-sex roommate (on some trips you can choose the ‘room to myself’ option for a little extra).]]></text>
		</block>
		<block>
			<title col="black">GOING IT ALONE VS. GOING WITH CONTIKI</title>
			<text><![CDATA[Exploring any new country is an epic experience & we want to make sure you make it count. Don’t line up for hours, or get lost trying to navigate your way from the train station at 11pm in the rain… We’d rather you spent the evening with us at a Parisian Cabaret or toasting Uluru at sunset with champagne. There is nothing worse than FOMO – we have the perfect balance of organising the most amazing must-sees so you don’t miss a thing & give you the freedom & flexibility to discover your own way (we have a heap of ME Time built into all our trips). Really, the only things fixed are your destinations.]]></text>
		</block>
		<block>
			<title col="black">TRAVEL EXPERTS</title>
			<text><![CDATA[Practice makes perfect. We’ve taken over a million young travellers around the globe over the years, so it’s safe to say we’ve nailed the art of making every moment count & sending our travellers home with absolutely #NOREGRETS. We have family relationships with local suppliers in every nook & cranny of the world (some that span 50+ years... no joke!) & a team of Trip Managers that gives us a knowledge of how to explore that would surprise even the locals. Trust us, we’ve got this. Check out contiki.com/team for more.]]></text>

			<title col="black">VALUE</title>
			<text><![CDATA[You can’t see & do as much as we do with the same value any other way. We’ve been in business now for 53 years & have some pretty sweet relationships with the people & places we visit & stay at all over this great planet. This means we can guarantee you’ll get the best prices on everything we include & some pretty special treatment if you are travelling with Contiki.]]></text>

			<title col="black">CULTURAL HIGHLIGHTS</title>
			<text><![CDATA[For us culture isn’t just about grand museums (although we do take you to some of the world’s best!). It’s about getting immersed in the things that make different cultures what they are today, as well as their history. We want you to see the monuments you’ve seen in movies & read in books. And we want you to experience the foods, fashion trends, music differences & art references that make these destinations so different and amazing. We’re so passionate about these cultural differences we have a whole blog on it (contiki.com/exchange).]]></text>

		<block-intro>
			<text>THE MOST EXCITING THING ABOUT YOUR TRIP IS THE PLACES YOU ARE GOING TO SEE. BUT WE KNOW THERE IS ALSO A BUNCH OF PRACTICAL STUFF THAT’S EQUALLY IMPORTANT &amp; THE REASON WHY YOUR TRIP WITH CONTIKI WILL BE ONE&#160;&#160; WITH #NOREGRETS.</text>
		</block-intro>
			<block>
				<title col="indigo">TEAM</title>
				<text><![CDATA[The best thing about travelling with us is our Team. They went through the mother of all training trips to get this gig & between them have over 150 years experience travelling… They’ll show you destinations you choose in a way you wouldn’t be able to discover on your own. They’re all international nomads with a passion for travel & can’t wait to show you the places they now call home.

			<block>
				<title col="green">INCLUSIONS</title>
				<text><![CDATA[We have more inclusions on our itineraries than anyone in the business, giving you more choice on how to spend your days. We know it’s important to see the blockbusters & cultural highlights when you travel so they’re all included. And thanks to our sweet connections in each destination, we save you time – like queue skipping at the Eiffel Tower, Colosseum & Angkor Wat to name a few. And we include accommodation every single night of your trip.]]></text>

				<title col="orange">ME TIME</title>
				<text><![CDATA[ME Time is all about the freedom & flexibility to explore in your free time. The only things fixed on your itinerary are the places you visit. In each destination you can make the choice to chill out & explore on your own time or take part in our ME Time optionals, which will give you an even more epic travel experience. Ask your Trip Manager for some tips on where to explore in the cities you’ll visit. Check out contiki.com/metime for some of our ME Time faves.]]></text>

				<title col="cyan">GETTING AROUND</title>
				<text><![CDATA[Getting around with us can include planes, trains & boats depending on your trip style & destination. On most of our trips we prefer to travel on one of our fleet of modern coaches, it’s actually the most hassle free & comfortable way to get around (air con, tv screens, WiFi & chargers on some). We’re not that keen on hauling our bags miles between train stations & our accommodation… we like to make sure getting to the places you visit is as quick & comfy as possible.]]></text>
			</block>
			<block>
				<title col="magenta">FOOD</title>
				<text><![CDATA[We’re a bunch of foodies here at Contiki, and there is nothing better than tasting your way through various cultures. Our food philosophy is quality over quantity. Stop reading now if you’re going to get excited about an included soggy sandwich with questionable meat on the side of a highway. Every Contiki itinerary includes breakfast every day – lunch we leave to you to experience your way & depending on your travel experience you’ll eat dinner in some of our favourite local restaurants.]]></text>
