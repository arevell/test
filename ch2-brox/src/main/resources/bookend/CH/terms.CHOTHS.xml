<div>NB: Please note, Contiki’s cancellation policy is different in Asia due to internal flight ticketing timeframes &amp;ground transport confirmations. These must be booked well in advance in order to secure high quality services that adhere to our strict safety standards. Where the percentage cancellation fee is less than the trip deposit, the cancellation fee will equal loss of deposit. If the reason for cancellation falls within the terms of any holiday insurance policy which you hold, then any such charges may, subject to the terms of your insurance policy, be refunded to you by the insurance company.
</div>
<div>3.4 Any cancellation of additional services within 14 days from date of service, such as pre &amp;post accommodation &amp;transfers, will incur a 100% cancellation fee.

</div>
<div>3.5 These cancellation fees are in addition to any cancellation fees that may be levied by your Travel Agent.

</div>
<div>4.2 A fee of R200 per person will be charged for any revision or alteration made to a reservation after the booking is confirmed unless the change increases the value of the booking.
