A contract is only made between you and us upon your booking being confirmed and accepted by us and our communication thereof to either you or your travel agent.
</div>
<bold>2. PRICE GUARANTEE

No surcharges in respect of cost or currency fluctuations will be made once payment has been received.

</div>

</div>
<div>3.5 Contiki is not responsible for any other travel arrangements affected due to our cancellations or rescheduling of any trip departure.
</div>
<bold>4. VACATION DETAILS AND CONDITIONS

</div>
<div>NB: Please note, Contiki’s cancellation policy is different in Asia due to internal flight ticketing timeframes &amp; ground transport confirmations. These must be booked well in advance in order to secure high quality services that adhere to our strict safety standards. Where the percentage cancellation fee is less than the trip deposit, the cancellation fee will equal loss of deposit. If the reason for cancellation falls within the terms of any holiday insurance policy which you hold, then any such charges may, subject to the terms of your insurance policy, be refunded to you by the insurance company.
</div>
<div>3.3 Any cancellation of additional services within 14 days from date of service, such as pre &amp; post accommodation &amp; transfers, will incur a 100% cancellation fee. For cancellation of additional services outside of 14 days from date of service, please refer to the above cancellation policy.
</div>
<div>3.4 These cancellation fees are in addition to any cancellation fees that may be levied by your Travel Agent. All cancellation policies valid as at 29th October, 2014 and are subject to change. Final policy will be confirmed at time of booking.
</div>
<bold>4. IF YOU CHANGE YOUR BOOKING
</bold>
<div>4.1 If after your booking has been confirmed, you wish to change to an alternate departure date or you wish to change to a different Contiki vacation, you may do so subject to availability and provided the new vacation date is also in this brochure.
</div>
<div>4.2 A fee of C$30 per person will be charged for any revision or alteration made to a reservation after the booking is confirmed unless the change increases the value of the booking. A change of trip date or trip itinerary within 45 days of departure date will be treated as a cancellation, and normal cancellation fees will apply except when the change is to an earlier trip departure of equivalent or greater value in which case a C$30 per person amendment fee will be charged.
</div>
<div>4.3 Air Cancellation &amp; Changes: Prior to airline ticketing, a service fee C$35 per person and after airline ticketing a service fee of C$75 per person, plus any airline imposed penalties which may be up to 100% of the air ticket price, will be charged. If paper tickets are issued, no refund will be made for canceled air tickets until after the paper tickets are returned to Contiki. Non-refundable tickets cannot be refunded. Please ensure any returned guided vacation document which contains airline tickets is sent by certified or registered mail. Lost ticket replacement can take up to one year and processing fees may be assessed.
</div>
<div>4.4 Air Seating: Not all airlines offer pre-assigned seats. Some may charge for pre-assigned seats. Any additional charge imposed by airlines will be at guests’ expense. Where pre-assigned seats are not offered or different seats are desired, guests must contact airline(s) direct to arrange seating assignments. Seating is solely under the airline’s control, as are itinerary changes due to flight delays and schedule changes. Contiki reserves the right to offer alternative schedules for itineraries affected by airline schedule changes and equipment. Flight delays, flight cancellation and schedule changes are the responsibility of the airline. Contiki will not be responsible or liable for such delays or rescheduling, and additional charges may be involved.
</div>

Contiki cannot be held responsible for your failure to take out appropriate insurance. You also agree to indemnify us against all third-party claims, actions, damages and remedies which may be brought against us in respect of your participation in the holiday.
