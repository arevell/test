</div>
<div>NB: Please note, Contiki’s cancellation policy is different in Asia due to internal flight ticketing timeframes &amp; ground transport confirmations. These must be booked well in advance in order to secure high quality services that adhere to our strict safety standards. When the percentage cancellation fee is less than the trip deposit, the cancellation fee will equal loss of deposit. If the reason for cancellation falls within the terms of any holiday insurance policy which you hold, then any such charges may, subject to the terms of your insurance policy, be refunded to you by the insurance company.
</div>
<div>3.4 Any cancellation of additional services within 14 days from date of service, such as pre &amp; post accommodation &amp; transfers, will incur a 100% cancellation fee. For cancellation of additional services outside of 14 days from date of service, please refer to the above cancellation policy.
</div>
<div>3.5 These cancellation fees are in addition to any cancellation fees that may be levied by your Travel Agent. All Cancellation policies valid as at 24th October, 2014, and are subject to change. Final policy will be confirmed at time of booking.
</div>
<bold>4. IF YOU CHANGE YOUR BOOKING
</bold>
<div>4.1 If after your booking has been confirmed, you wish to change to alternate departure date or you wish to change to a different Contiki holiday, you may do so subject to availability &amp; provided the new holiday date is also in this brochure.
</div>
<div>4.2 A fee of NZ$30 per person will be charged for any revision or alteration made to a reservation after the booking is confirmed unless the change increases the value of the booking. A change of trip date, trip itinerary booking within 45 days of departure date will be treated as a cancellation, &amp; normal cancellation fees will apply except when the change is to an earlier departure date of equivalent or greater value in which case a NZ$30 per person amendment fee will be charged.
</div>
<bold>5. HOLIDAY DETAILS &amp; CONDITIONS

We do not tolerate the possession or carriage of illegal or restricted substances (drugs). Furthermore, you agree that your fellow travellers &amp; any Contiki Representative has the right to travel/work in a safe environment.
