            <Title>Tour Prices</Title>
            <Text><strong>Prices are per person.</strong>
				Tour prices are based on costs, charges, tariffs, rates, prices, taxes, levies and
                exchange rates as at time this eBrochure was created. Should these change, the price
                of your holiday may increase. No surcharges in respect of cost or currency
                fluctuations will be made once payment for the deposit of your land tour is
                received. This does not apply to fuel surcharges and any taxes, charges or levies
                imposed by any government or their agencies. In exchange for these guarantees, no
                refund will be made if costs are reduced. Please note that if the total tour price
                increases by more than 10%, passengers will have the right to cancel their tour
                within 7 days of notification of the surcharge without penalty.</Text>

            <Title>Tour Cancellation</Title>
            <Text>Trafalgar reserves the right to cancel or re-schedule any tour departure in
                accordance with operating requirements or circumstances beyond its control. If
                cancellation is made any time prior to departure of the tour, Trafalgar's only
                liability will be to refund to the passenger the amount it has received for the tour
                booking. Trafalgar will try to re-book the same or similar tour and, <strong>where
                    flights have been confirmed by Trafalgar</strong>, will attempt to confirm air
                seats for new dates selected, subject to availability. Please note that Trafalgar is
                not liable for any cancellation penalties incurred on any other travel arrangements
                including air tickets purchased separately from the Air + Land inclusive
                package.</Text>
